# AT42QT1070 Acorn Arduino Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/skerr92/at42qt-acorn.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/skerr92/at42qt-acorn)


<h1 style="color: blue">Introduction</h1>

This library is for using the AT42QT1070 Capacitive Touch Sensor made by Microchip
and implemented on the AT42QT1070 Acorn by Oak Development Technologies.

<h1 style="color: blue">Usage</h1>

The AT42QT Capacitive touch chips can be used to develop touch control interfaces,
measure capacitance, among many other novel uses for the device.

Oak Development Technologies created a simple to use breakout to prototype faster.
As such, most users might use this breakout with Arduino.
